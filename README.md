The SINAG Web Portal is a GIS platform hosting spatial data and a forecasting model for assessing solar PV installations. It serves as a repository for outputs from the SolarPot and OutSolar components of the SINAG project. Developed with tools like Python, JavaScript, and a CMS on a cloud-based Linux system, the portal stores processed spatial data, model summaries, mapping tools, and more. It aims to support site selection for solar PV systems across the Philippines.
