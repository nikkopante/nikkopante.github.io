# Projects

### 1. PhilSA Space Data Catalog
[Link](https://catalog.data.philsa.gov.ph/)

![sdc](./docs/assets/sdc.png)

The PhilSA Space Data Catalog lets users explore available satellite images that can be requested from the Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA). The application is built using Spatiotemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) for serving assets and Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) for seamless access of images.

### 2. PhilSA Space Data Dashboard

![sdd](./docs/assets/sdd.png)

The PhilSA Space Data Dashboard lets users access derived space data products such as Land Surface Temperature (LST), Flood Maps, Air Quality, etc. I helped setup the Geoserver backend to enable serving of data.

### 3. PhilSA ODK Central

The PhilSA ODK Central holds the database for citizen science data collection. The application has been used for disaster validation, improve mangrove maps, and land cover classification validation. I helped set up and maintain the app.


### 4. WebGIS for Project SINAG

![sinag](./docs/assets/sinag.png)

The SINAG Web Portal is a GIS platform hosting spatial data and a forecasting model for assessing solar PV installations. It serves as a repository for outputs from the SolarPot and OutSolar components of the SINAG project. Developed with tools like Python, JavaScript, and a CMS on a cloud-based Linux system, the portal stores processed spatial data, model summaries, mapping tools, and more. It aims to support site selection for solar PV systems across the Philippines.

### 5. Iloilo City Proper Building Roofs Solar Potential

![iloilo](./docs/assets/iloilo.png)

A web application showing solar photovoltaic energy potential of buildings in Iloilo City, Philippines. This is a project under my GmE 231 (LiDAR Remote Sensing) class. We were tasked to replicate an existing study on LiDAR applications. I picked Prieto et. al (2019) study on a methodology for computing solar potential of building roofs, creating 3D models, and presenting them in a web application.

### 6. DIWATA QGIS Browser

![qgis](./docs/assets/qgis.png)

The DIWATA Image Browser is a QGIS plugin that allows users to browse and download optical images captured by the DIWATA-2 satellite, a technology demonstration satellite owned by the Philippines. This plugin utilizes STAC and COG to index, visualize, and distribute satellite images. We will demonstrate how the QGIS environment communicates with the STAC endpoint to search and retrieve desired STAC items. The plugin speeds up the workflow by letting users load the images straight to the QGIS environment, bypass data preparation, and make data ready for analysis. I was able to present this project at the Open Geospatial Consortium 2022.

### 7. DIWATA Operations Software, Image Browser, Data Pipeline, and Tracker

I was able to contribute to different applications for the management, access, and processing of DIWATA-2 images in the Ground Receiving, Archiving, Science Product Development and Distribution (GRASED) project under the Space Technology and Applications Mastery, Innovation, and Advancement (STAMINA4Space) program funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and implemented by the Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI) and University of the Philippines Diliman.
